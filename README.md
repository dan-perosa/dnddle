# DNDdle: Your Daily D&D Guessing Game

**DNDdle** is a fun and addictive daily word game inspired by popular titles like Wordle, Loldle, and Dotadle. But with a twist: it's all about *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition*!

### How to Play
1. **Guess the Monster:** Each day, a new monster is randomly selected from the D&D 5e API.
2. **Make Your Guess:** Type in a monster name and hit enter.
3. **Get Feedback:**
   - **Correct:** The letter is in the correct place and is part of the monster's name.
   - **Present:** The letter is in the monster's name but in the wrong place.
   - **Absent:** The letter is not in the monster's name.
4. **Repeat:** You have six tries to guess the correct monster!

### Built With
* **Next.js:** For a fast and scalable React framework.
* **TypeScript:** For type safety and better code maintainability.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development and customization.
* **D&D 5e API:** Providing all monster data.
